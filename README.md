# Excercise-3-Generative-Images-using-Diffusion



This was created through a combination of Dreamstudio.ai and Google Colab's Stable Diffusion. 

The details behind each photo can be found in the md files of their respective folders. 

These are some of my favorite photos from this experiment:

The majority of these photos were created through a sample Image, then re-edited inpainting with another re-edit done in DreamStudio.ai

## Artistic Inspiration

The past week, I had been watching a few Tomb Raider interviews on YouTube since the films had randomly appeared on my TV coming home from work. I figured to look more into the artistic depiction of the Character Created by Toby Gard, when I came across this sample Portrait image on google, I Immediately thought of Tomb Raider but during the character's early days as a major Playstation 1 character.

Much of the artwork done was heavily based around Ultra-Realism with a CyberPunk theme. 

Other inspirations came from Hyperrealist artist Ron Mueck. Most notably his work "Chicken Man"
